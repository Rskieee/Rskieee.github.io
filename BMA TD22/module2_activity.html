      <h2>Facts and History</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>FEU Tech History</h3>
        <p>
          The story of FEU Tech begins in 1936. The Philippines was still under the Commonwealth, but independence was on the horizon. FEU, already known as a pioneer in private education, recognized a growing need for engineers and technologists who could help build the nation. To answer this challenge, the Institute of Technology was born.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the start, Civil Engineering was the only program offered. But the demand for skilled professionals quickly grew, and FEU responded by opening programs in mechanical, electrical, industrial, chemical, and geodetic engineering. For a time, even architecture and chemistry were part of its scope. 
        </p>

        <p>
          What made FEU Tech stand out was its balance: drawing inspiration from global institutions like MIT and the University of Michigan while tailoring its courses to fit <span class="local-focus">Philippine realities</span>. The goal was always clear—produce graduates who were not just technical experts,but problem-solvers who could serve the country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alongside this vision, FEU invested in people and facilities. It gathered some of the country’s finest educators and engineers, built advanced laboratories, and eventually constructed a landmark seven-story Technology Building in Manila, as well as a modern campus in Quezon City.

        <h3>A New Technology</h3>
        <p>
          By the early 1990s, the world was changing rapidly computers were no longer luxuries, they were necessities. FEU once again adapted, shifting its focus from traditional engineering to computer technology. Partnering with organizations like IBM Philippines and SM Foundation, 
FEU launched what would later be known as the East Asia Institute of Computer Technology (EAICT).
        </p>

        <p>
          Degrees in Computer Science, Information Technology, and later Computer Engineering soon became available. In 2000, CHED even recognized the institute as a Center of Development for Excellence in IT education. By the mid-2000s, FEU had taken full control and merged the IT and engineering schools, bringing their strengths together.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, in 2014, the institution proudly returned to its roots, reclaiming its original name: the FEU Institute of Technology, or simply, FEU Tech.
