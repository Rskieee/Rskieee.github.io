      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 2nd-year Bachelor of Multimedia Arts student at FEU-TECH. I specialize in traditional art while continuously developing my skills in digital media. 
        My work explores creativity across various mediums, bringing imagination and emotions to life through illustrations, 3D art, and animations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy experimenting with different techniques and styles to enhance my artistic versatility, from soft pastel sketches to detailed digital renders. 
        I also participate in freelance projects and collaborative works, which help me refine my skills and create a diverse portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Art has always been an integral part of who I am. I draw inspiration from everyday life, nature, and stories around me. 
        Every piece I create reflects my personal style and passion for visual storytelling, aiming to connect with viewers on a deeper level.
